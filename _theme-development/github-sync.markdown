When you're making a theme, you'll want to keep your content on Siteleaf and your code on GitHub to be in sync. This is exactly what GitHub Sync was made for.

When you turn on Sync, you'll be asked to "Connect with GitHub". You'll then need to choose a repository to sync to. Once this is all set up, every time you update Siteleaf or GitHub, the change will be reflected within the other site.
