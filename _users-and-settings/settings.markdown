Under the "General" tab in your site settings, you can change several aspects of the site.

### Title

The site title is required.

### Timezone

This is what Siteleaf bases your timestamps off of.

### Permalink

This is an advanced Jekyll option that changes the format of your post permalinks. By default, Siteleaf uses the `pretty` permalink style.

Style     | URL Template
----------|-------------
`date`    | `/:categories/:year/:month/:day/:title.html`
`pretty`  | `/:categories/:year/:month/:day/:title`
`ordinal` | `/:categories/:year/:y_day/:title.html`
`none`    | `/:categories/:title.html`
