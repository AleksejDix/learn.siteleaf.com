Siteleaf is a smart, lightweight platform for creating and maintaining websites. We believe that content management shouldn’t be hard. That you should be able to host your website anywhere you want. That websites should be able to outlive their CMS. That our tools should be simplified, not dumbed down.

Siteleaf is fully compatible with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), the same open source technology GitHub uses to power over half a million websites. Enjoy the benefits of a large open source community, along with the accessibility of the Siteleaf interface you’ve come to love. Use any off-the-shelf Jekyll theme, or take your Siteleaf theme with you.

For a long time, static site generators have been the ideal tool for developers: they’re wicked fast, work easily with version control, and are easier to set up compared to other content management systems.

But when it comes to people that are less tech-saavy, static site generators are difficult to use. They often require knowledge of the command line, and text editors aren’t always the easiest programs to write content in.

This is where Siteleaf comes in. Siteleaf gives developers the ease of working with static site generators, while giving clients the interface of a bigger CMS.
