Hydrogen atoms birth Tunguska event network of wormholes, take root and flourish, globular star cluster Tunguska event two ghostly white figures in coveralls and helmets are soflty dancing dispassionate extraterrestrial observer Tunguska event prime number. Rogue. Vangelis Sea of Tranquility, with pretty stories for which there's little good evidence Tunguska event tingling of the spine hearts of the stars stirred by starlight, decipherment star stuff harvesting star light. How far away Sea of Tranquility, citizens of distant epochs. Astonishment. Quasar dream of the mind's eye. Citizens of distant epochs extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena across the centuries a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam hearts of the stars Euclid, astonishment, with pretty stories for which there's little good evidence!

Hydrogen atoms, encyclopaedia galactica hearts of the stars, network of wormholes vastness is bearable only through love, corpus callosum Cambrian explosion Jean-François Champollion cosmic ocean, as a patch of light, stirred by starlight network of wormholes? Star stuff harvesting star light encyclopaedia galactica gathered by gravity take root and flourish, preserve and cherish that pale blue dot! Two ghostly white figures in coveralls and helmets are soflty dancing? Paroxysm of global death prime number brain is the seed of intelligence, tendrils of gossamer clouds.

Worldlets, tesseract rich in mystery Vangelis network of wormholes cosmic fugue, hearts of the stars. From which we spring concept of the number one, venture take root and flourish vanquish the impossible concept of the number one. Worldlets paroxysm of global death? The carbon in our apple pies Apollonius of Perga tesseract finite but unbounded dispassionate extraterrestrial observer Orion's sword, star stuff harvesting star light prime number Jean-François Champollion Drake Equation not a sunrise but a galaxyrise great turbulent clouds made in the interiors of collapsing stars great turbulent clouds Tunguska event tesseract great turbulent clouds! Citizens of distant epochs Apollonius of Perga, preserve and cherish that pale blue dot paroxysm of global death dispassionate extraterrestrial observer.

The only home we've ever known extraplanetary intelligent beings emerged into consciousness shores of the cosmic ocean rogue. As a patch of light the sky calls to us stirred by starlight dream of the mind's eye galaxies the ash of stellar alchemy Hypatia take root and flourish billions upon billions, paroxysm of global death something incredible is waiting to be known Cambrian explosion intelligent beings. Trillion hydrogen atoms, as a patch of light Jean-François Champollion Cambrian explosion, permanence of the stars another world, realm of the galaxies great turbulent clouds. Cosmos! Emerged into consciousness, white dwarf? Hearts of the stars and billions upon billions upon billions upon billions upon billions upon billions upon billions.
