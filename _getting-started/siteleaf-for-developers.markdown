Siteleaf aims to be a content management system that bridges the gap between easy to develop for and easy to use for clients. For a long time, static site generators have been the ideal tool for developers: they’re wicked fast, work easily with version control, and are easier to set up compared to other content management systems. But when it comes to people that are less tech-saavy, static site generators are difficult to use. They often require knowledge of the command line, and text editors aren’t always the easiest programs to write content in.

Siteleaf is fully compatible with Jekyll, the same open source technology GitHub uses to power over half a million websites. Enjoy the benefits of a large open source community, along with the accessibility of the Siteleaf interface. Use any off-the-shelf Jekyll theme, or build your own.
