You can think of Siteleaf Preview as your site's staging environment. This is where you can preview your changes before publishing them live or share the pending changes with your editor or client. When you're logged in you'll notice a bar at the top of your site indicating the status of your site's preview, informing you of when the preview was last generated or if there were errors encountered generating the preview.
