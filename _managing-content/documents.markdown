Documents are pieces of related content in a [Collection](/managing-content/collections.html). They're similar to [Pages](/managing-content/pages.html), except they belong to a collection rather than the site itself.

## Options

### Visibility

By default, documents are visible. You can change this by switching it to hidden.

### Date

The timestamp associated with the document.

### Permalink

The permalink changes the path the document is accessible at on your site.

### Layout

The layout field lets you select which layout in `_layouts/` this document should use.
