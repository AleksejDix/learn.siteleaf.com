A page is the most basic content type in Siteleaf. They belong directly to your site, and don't belong to a particular collection.

A page is linked to a Markdown file in your project that contains frontmatter and your body.

### Visibility

By default, pages are visible. You can change this by switching it to hidden.

### Date

This changes the timestamp associated with the page.

### Permalink

The permalink changes the path the page is accessible at on your site.

### Layout

The layout field lets you select which layout in `_layouts/` this page should use.
